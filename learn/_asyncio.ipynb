    "\n",
    "# Intro\n",
    "* Asynchronous IO (async IO): a language agnostic model that has implementations across a host of programming languages\n",
    "* async/await: two new Python keywords that are used to define coroutines\n",
    "* asyncio: the Python package that provides a foundation and API for running and managing coroutines\n",
    "\n",
    "# Concepts\n",
    "* <b>Parallelism</b> consists of performing multipple operations at the same time. <b>Multiprocessing</b> is a means to effect parallelism to spread tasks over CPUs or cores.\n",
    "   * e.g. tightly bound `for` loops\n",
    "* <b>Concurrency</b> is broader than parallelism. It suggest that multiple tasks have the ability to run in an overlapping manner.\n",
    "* <b>Threading</b> is a concurrent execution model where multiple threads thak turns executing tasks.\n",
    "   * threading is better for IO-bound tasks, which is dominated by a lot of wiating on input/output to complete.\n",
    "   \n",
    "# Async IO\n",
    "* Async IO is a single-threaded, single-process design tha uses <b>cooperative multitasking</b>\n",
    "* It gives a feeling of concurrency despite using a single thread in a single process\n",
    "* Coroutines (a central feature of async IO) can be scheduled concurrently, but they are not inherently concurrent.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does it mean to be <b>asynchronous</b>?\n",
    "It has two properties:\n",
    "* Asynchronous routines are able to 'pause' while waiting on their ultimate result and let other routines run in the meantime.\n",
    "* Asynchronous code, through the mechanism above facilitates concurrent execution (feels like concurrency)."
